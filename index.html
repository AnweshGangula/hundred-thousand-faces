    <p>Covid-19 has now killed over 100,000 Americans, a number that defies comprehension. This website is intended to help visitors understand the massive scale of this event by putting a human face on each person lost. It is my hope that this will allow visitors to understand the death toll as more than just a number.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">The faces on this page do not and have never existed. They were generated by a computer.</span> They have been curated to provide a demographically accurate view of the actual covid-19 victims, accounting for age, race, and gender. You can read more about the making of this page <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>As you scroll, try to suspend your disbelief of these virtual images and consider the real person symbolized by each oneâ€”the life they lived, the way they died, and the family they left behind.</p>
